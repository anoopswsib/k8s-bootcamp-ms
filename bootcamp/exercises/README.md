# Setting up your environment

There are multiple options for provisioning a K8S cluster.  For our purposes, we will use AKS as it is the easiest way to set up a multi-node cluster on Azure.  For local development, you can set up Minikube, which provides you a single node K8S cluster.  An alternative is [bootkube](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/bootkube/tree/master/hack/multi-node) which provides you a local, multi-node cluster to test multi-node scenarios.  I provide you instructions below to provision an AKS cluster and also setting up Minikube.

You will need the following tools installed:

* [Azure CLI](#markdown-header-installing-azure-cli)
* [docker (only required if you will be building the docker images)](#markdown-header-install-docker)
* [Helm (a package management tool for Kubernetes applications)](#markdown-header-install-helm)
* [kubectl (The kubernetes CLI)](#markdown-header-create-a-k8s-cluster-on-azure-and-install-kubectl)
* [Visual Studio Code](#markdown-header-install-visual-studio-code)
* [Minikube (optional, only if you want to run all the exercises)](#markdown-header-setting-up-minikube)

**Note: You can do most of the exercises using Azure Cloud Shell directly from your portal Dashboard.  When you start up cloud shell for the first time, it will ask you to confirm creating a storage account. If asked, select your subscription, then confirm creating the storage account.  Cloud shell will already have az cli, git, kubectl and helm installed.  Once you initialize cloud shell, clone my git repository located at https://github.com/jungho/k8s-bootcamp.git.  You can always access Azure cloud shell from https://shell.azure.com or from your portal dashboard at https://portal.azure.com.**

**Tip: Install Azure Account Extension to access Azure Cloud Shell from VS Code! https://www.michaelcrump.net/azure-tips-and-tricks49/**

## Installing Azure CLI

Install the latest version of azure cli for your operating system from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Install Docker

*This portion is only required if you will be building Docker images locally and if you want to deploy a local openshift cluster using the oc cli*

Install docker for your operating system.

* For [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* For [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* For [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#docker-ee-customers)

After you have installed docker and the azure cli, run the following commands to ensure they have been installed.

```sh
az --version
docker version
```
## Install Visual Studio Code

Download and install VS Code for your OS.  [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Optionally, install the following extensions (search in the extensions tab):

* Kubernetes (from Microsoft)
* Kubernetes Support (provides snippets for authoring manifests)
* Docker

## Verify your Azure subscription ##

Make sure all the required resource providers are registered in your Azure subscription.  As you will be creating network, compute and storage resources on Azure, and you will be using Azure Container Service, you need to ensure you have the following providers registered in your Azure subscription:

* Microsoft.Network
* Microsoft.Storage
* Microsoft.Compute
* Microsoft.ContainerService
* Microsoft.ContainerRegistry (If you will be using Azure Container Registry)

To determine which providers are registered run this command:

```sh
#login to your Azure subscription
az login

#list your registered providers
az provider list -o table | less
```

The registration state of each of the providers above should be 'Registered'.  If not, you need to register the provider using the following command:

```sh
az provider register -n <provider-name>
```

For example,

```sh
az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerService
```

## Create a K8S cluster using AKS on Azure and install kubectl ##

After you have verified your subscription has the necessary providers registered, create a test K8S cluster on Azure. To do so, run the following commands (you already have to be logged into Azure via the CLI). Note, I use the resource group name ``k8s-example`` and cluster name ``test-cluster`` but you can name them what you want.

* Create a resource group for your cluster. Note you have to be logged in via az cli.

```sh
#For region use canadaeast, replace <rg-name> with your desired resource group name
#You will need to use this resource group in later steps
az group create -n <rg-name> -l canadacentral
```

* See what versions of Kubernetes is available.

```sh
az aks get-versions -l <region> -o table

#You should see something like this.

```

* Create the Kubernetes cluster.  We will use version 1.10.x

```sh
#this will create a cluster with 1 master node, 2 worker nodes with Kubernetes version 1.10.3
#replace <cluster-name> with the desired name for your cluster, replace <rg-group> with you resource group name
#If you already have your own ssh keys in ~/.ssh directory, you do not have to use the --generate-ssh-keys option
az aks create -g <rg-name> -n <cluster-name> -c 2 -k 1.10.3 -l <region> --generate-ssh-keys

#list your AKS cluster
az aks list -o table

#The result will be a table with your AKS cluster name, location, ResourceGroup...
Name         Location    ResourceGroup    KubernetesVersion    ProvisioningState    Fqdn
-----------  ----------  ---------------  -------------------  -------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------
aks-cluster  canadaeast  k8s-example      1.10.3               Succeeded            aks-cluste-k8s-example-17ef54-83abd6a2.hcp.canadaeast.azmk8s.io

```

* Install the kubectl cli, if on linux, or macOS, you may have to run as sudo

```sh
az aks install-cli

#Get credentials for your cluster so you can authenticate using kubectl
az aks get-credentials -n <cluster-name> -g <rg-name>
```

* Verify you can access the cluster

```sh

kubectl get nodes

#you should see something like this
NAME                       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
aks-nodepool1-89511720-0   Ready     agent     8m        v1.10.3
aks-nodepool1-89511720-1   Ready     agent     8m        v1.10.3
```

* Start up proxy to tunnel to the Kubernetes Dashboard

```sh
kubectl proxy
```

Open a brower and navigate to ```http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy/``` and you will see the dashboard.

**Note, with the latest version AKS, the dashboard service account role does not have sufficient privileges to view resources within the default namespace.  For instructions on how to enable this, see [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Access-control#admin-privileges).*

## Install Kubectx and Kubens ##

When working with Kubernetes, you will very quickly discover that you will be switching back and forth between different clusters and namespaces.  Install `kubectx` and `kubens` to enable you to do so quickly.

[https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx)

## Install Helm

To install helm follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md). Install v2.9.1. Note that to install the server side of Helm (tiller), you need the K8S cluster running. 

```sh
helm init --upgrade
```

## Bringing down your cluster

In order to not incur Azure costs, you should tear down your cluster when not in use.  At the end of each day just delete the resource group.

```sh
az group delete -n <rg-name>
```
## Setting up Minikube

This part is only for those of you who want to work on a local cluster with the latest version of Kubernetes.

See the installation instructions for your OS [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases)

*I have used v0.28.2*

*Note for Windows, you need to make a decision if you are going to use Hyper-V or Virtualbox for virtualization.  If you have installed Docker with Hyper-V then you have to choose Hyper-V for Minikube also to support both.*

*Note for Linux, if you have enabled Secure Boot in your BIOS, then you need to sign the virtualbox kernel modules. See this [article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/760671/could-not-load-vboxdrv-after-upgrade-to-ubuntu-16-04-and-i-want-to-keep-secur) The easiest is to just disable Secure Boot.*

Once installed, run the following command to start up Minikube.  This will download the latest release of K8S and start a single node cluster locally.

```minikube start```

To view the Dashboard run:

```minikube dashboard```

To stop minikube and bring down the cluster:

```minikube stop```

Some useful minikube commands:

```sh
#to get the IP to your minikube master
minikube ip

#to get the URL of a service deployed to minikube
minikube service <service-name>

#to ssh into a pod
minikube ssh <pod-name>

#to delete the local K8S VM
minikube delete
```

## What is AKS, ACS, and ACS Engine?

AKS is a new fully managed service that frees you from worrying about managing the underlying VM, storage, and network resources.  With ACS, you are responsible for patching the OS etc, while with AKS you do not need to worry about these operational tasks.  ACS has now been deprecated and has been replaced by AKS.

ACS Engine is an open source project that allows you to customize your K8S deployment on Azure.  It generates the ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates to provision the virtual machines, the storage, network, and then the K8S cluster.  It is much more flexible in terms of K8S features you can enable.  For example, if you need to enable features such as AdvancedAuditing, select your host OS version, need more control over how your master and worker nodes are deployed to the Azure VNET, etc then you need to use ACS Engine.  However, you are responsible for maintaining ALL the resources and hence you will need to have the processes and skillset to do so.  In a nutshell, you can think of ACS Engine as *IaaS* and AKS as *PaaS* versions of Kubernetes on Azure.
